KPI NPS Report July 2023 Version 2.0 Table of contents Document Goals Definition of the KPI 2.1 Metric Details 2.2 NPS Definition KPI Business Use Cases 3.1 Key Insights Required KPI Data Sources 4.1 Metric Granularity 4.2 Segments (Dimensions /Filters / Slicers) 4.3 Caveats & Clarifications 4.4 Known Issues Data Processing Details Sample SQL Queries 6.1 Use Case 1 - To fetch non-EBA Qualtrics IDs per fiscal year 6.2 Use Case 2 - To fetch Qualtrics IDs (EBA and non-EBA) per industry 6.3 Use Case 3 - To fetch EBA Qualtrics IDs per GEO 6.4 Use Case 4 - To calculate overall NPS (EBA and non-EBA) 6.5 Use Case 5 - To calculate EBA NPS 6.6 Use Case 6 - To connect NPS table with applicable dimensions Report / Data for Reconciliation Check List for Metric Owner Governance Data Quality & Monitoring 10.1 Known Data Quality Issues 10.2 Data Quality Checks 10.3 Inventory of Downstream Users 1. Document Goals Explain how the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Net Promotor Score is calculated using SQL Communicate a high-level understanding of the metric and how it can be used for leadership and director-levels Document the process for technical analysts to understand how to use the data/calculate the KPI as well as the appropriate business context to apply it 2. Definition of the KPI 2.1 Metric Details Item Details Metric Title Net Promoter Score (NPS) Metric Short Description NPS Metric Long Description Net Promoter Score Metric SME Jasson Ji Product Owner Uddipan Documentation Status IN PROGESS 2.2 NPS Definition NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a metric used in customer experience programmes. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100. A higher score is desirable. 3. KPI Business Use Cases Tracking NPS allows us to see how much our customers would recommend our product/service/the company to someone else We can track this KPI over periods of time and determine whether customer satisfaction with the product/service is improving or declining We can leverage this information to enhance our service and identify strengths for further improvement 3.1 Key Insights Achievements: The total number of survey responses have increased year on year since 2020 from 35 to over 100 in 2023. This is a positive result and an investigation as to what is working successfully can drive further results . The overall EBA NPS of 60 indicates a highly positive sentiment among employees who have access to our products or services. Leveraging this positive sentiment can contribute to a positive work environment and potentially boost employee engagement and productivity . Engagement in survey reponses is highest in the architecture industry . Geo_1 has the highest NPS , indicating a higher level of customer loyalty and satisfaction compared to the other locations. Improvements: The majority of respondents are unique customers with an unknown industry . Investigate to identify these industries. Improve survey participation and engagement, especially in construction and product design industries . Geo_3 has the lowest NPS , suggesting there is room for improvement in customer sentiment in this area. An overall NPS of 35 out of 100 shows signs of improvement to be made in the product/process/company . We can leverage NPS tables to facilitate in-depth analysis by exploring NPS scores alongside specific customer attributes, gaining insights into customer feedback and loyalty based on different dimensions. 4. Required KPI Data Sources 4.1 Metric Granularity Qualtrics_ID 4.2 Segments (Dimensions /Filters / Slicers) Country Customer Size Customer Tenure Geo Industry Group License Compliance ( WIP) Named account Named Account Group Customer Tenure Premium ( WIP) 4.3 Caveats & Clarifications Not all Qualtrics_id have an account_csn, hence not all qualtrics_id will have an account_name Explanation: Some survey responses in Qualtrics lack linked customer accounts, possibly due to anonymous or non-customer respondents. Impact: Because of this, when analyzing the survey data, there may be cases where the \"account_name\" field is empty or NULL for certain survey responses, while others will have valid account names associated with them. Action: Filter out non-account holder responses and handle them separately in survey results. Autodesk (ADSK_BUSINESS_SCORE) has its own unique NPS thresholds: \"PROMOTER\" are anyone who scores between 6-10 \"DETRACTOR\" are anyone who scores between 0-3 \"OTHERS\" are anyone who scores between 4-5 Some columns exclusively belong to EBA or NON-EBA, hence field EBA_FLAG is crucial for data navigation Explanation: Certain columns in the data are specific to either EBA (Employee-Based Access) or NON-EBA. The \"EBA_FLAG\" column is used to differenciate between these two data types. As of 31/07/2023, about 1850 qualtrics_id have multiple ACCOUNT_CSN mapped to them Some of these CSN's have multiple ACCOUNT_NAME, INDUSTRY & GEO, or multiple values in one of these filters. To ensure consistency, any qualtrics_id with multiple ACCOUNT_CSN will have ACCOUNT_NAME, INDUSTRY, and GEO set to 'UNKNOWN'. This approach helps maintain data clarity and reliability, standardizing the data to 'UNKNOWN' for ambiguous survey responses with multiple possible mappings to different customer accounts or information. It ensures consistent handling during analysis and reporting. 4.5 Known Issues The metric knowledge is being consolidated, gathering inputs from various experts to ensure a comprehensive understanding and informed decision-making based on combined expertise of the SMEs. 5. Data Processing Details How to Find the Table(s): 1. Go to the Data Warehouse. 2. Search for the \"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\" schema or database. 3. Look for the tables named: - \"X_PUBLISH\" - \"X_ADSK__MEMBERS\" - \"NPS_X_ADSK_TEAM_MEMBERS\" - \"NPS_NON_X_KEY_DRIVER_PRODUCTS\" - \"NPS_PRODUCTS_ENGMNT\" Note: - Some of these tables have different access roles (X_RO_GROUP), indicating permissions or restrictions on who can access them. - Each dataset will be updated daily at 07:30 UTC. - Some roles require admin rights to access certain tables Data Warehouse Schema/Database View/Table Roles with Access Time Partitions X_PUBLISH ENGAGEMENT_SHARED X_ADSK__MEMBERS X _RO_GROUP Not Applicable X_PUBLISH ENGAGEMENT_SHARED NPS_X _ADSK_TEAM_MEMBERS X _RO_GROUP Not Applicable X_PUBLISH ENGAGEMENT_SHARED NPS_NON_X_KEY_DRIVER_PRODUCTS X _RO_GROUP Not Applicable X_PUBLISH ENGAGEMENT_SHARED NPS_PRODUCTS_ENGMNT X _RO_GROUP Not Applicable 6. Sample SQL Queries 6.1 Use Case 1 To fetch non-EBA Qualtrics IDs per fiscal year SQL query: select FISCAL_YEAR, count(distinct qualtrics_id) as total_qualtrics_id from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where EBA_FLAG = 'FALSE' group by 1 Non-EBA Qualtrics IDs per Fiscal Year FISCAL_YEAR total_qualtrics_id 2023 100 2022 80 2021 50 2020 35 Here is the data in bar chart format: Table Summary The query helps identify the number of survey responses (Qualtrics IDs) submitted by non-EBA participants for each fiscal year. It focuses on data from a specific table and filters out only the relevant responses before grouping them by fiscal year for analysis. Table Results The total number of survey responses (Qualtrics IDs) have increased year on year since 2020 from 35 to over 100 responses in 2023. 6.2 Use Case 2 To fetch Qualtrics IDs (EBA and non-EBA) per industry SQL query: SELECT INDUSTRY, COUNT(DISTINCT QUALTRICS_ID), COUNT(DISTINCT account_csn) from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" GROUP BY INDUSTRY; INDUSTRY total_qualtrics_id total_account_csn UNKNOWN 1850 3700 CONSTRUCTION 1500 3000 ARCHITECTURE 1250 1500 PRODUCT DESIGN 900 1800 Here is the data in bar chart format: Table Summary The query helps identify the number of survey responses (Qualtrics IDs) and the number of unique customers (account_csn) for both EBA and non-EBA participants, categorized by different industries. It allows us to understand how many survey responses and unique customers are associated with each industry. Table Results Engagement and feedback vary by industry. The majority of respondents are unique customers with an unknown industry. Investigate to identify these industries. Improve survey participation and engagement, especially in construction and product design industries. 6.3 Use Case 3 To fetch EBA Qualtrics IDs per GEO SQL query: with count_rows as (select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as qualtrics_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" ) --where powerbi_geo = ''_) ,total_promoters as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as promoters_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score >='9') ,total_detractors as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as detractors_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score <='6') select promoters_perc - detractors_perc from ( select promoters_count/qualtrics_count as promoters_perc, detractors_count/qualtrics_count as detractors_perc from count_rows,total_promoters,total_detractors ) GEO Total EBA Qualtrics IDs Promoters Count Detractors Count NPS (Promoters - Detractors) Geo_1 1200 800 150 650 Geo_2 850 400 70 330 Geo_3 500 250 50 200 Here is the data in bar chart format: Table Summary \"GEO\" represents the geographic location categories for which the NPS is calculated. \"Total EBA Qualtrics IDs\" shows the total count of EBA Qualtrics survey responses for each geographic location. \"Promoters Count\" displays the count of Promoters (survey responses with a score of 9 or 10) in each GEO. \"Detractors Count\" shows the count of Detractors (survey responses with a score of 0 to 6) in each GEO. \"NPS (Promoters - Detractors)\" calculates the Net Promoter Score for each GEO by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. Each row in the table represents a different GEO category, and the corresponding columns contain the relevant information for that category. This tabular representation facilitates easy comparison of NPS values across different geographic locations, allowing for identification of regions with higher or lower levels of customer sentiment and loyalty. Table Results Geo_1 has 1200 EBA Qualtrics survey responses, with 800 promoters and 150 detractors, resulting in an NPS of 650. Geo_2 has 850 EBA Qualtrics survey responses, with 400 promoters and 70 detractors, resulting in an NPS of 330. Geo_3 has 500 EBA Qualtrics survey responses, with 250 promoters and 50 detractors, resulting in an NPS of 200. Overall, Geo_1 has the highest NPS, indicating a higher level of customer loyalty and satisfaction compared to the other locations. Geo_3 has the lowest NPS, suggesting there is room for improvement in customer sentiment in this area. 6.4 Use Case 4 To calculate overall NPS (EBA and non-EBA) SQL query: with count_rows as (select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as qualtrics_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" ) ,total_promoters as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as promoters_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score >='9') ,total_detractors as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as detractors_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score <='6') select promoters_perc - detractors_perc as overall_nps from ( select promoters_count/qualtrics_count as promoters_perc, detractors_count/qualtrics_count as detractors_perc from count_rows,total_promoters,total_detractors ) Overall NPS 35 Table Summary \"Overall NPS\" represents the calculated Net Promoter Score for both EBA (Employee-Based Access) and non-EBA Qualtrics survey responses combined. The table contains a single row, and the value \"35\" indicates the overall Net Promoter Score resulting from the analysis. The overall NPS is derived by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters, considering both EBA and non-EBA responses. This score provides an assessment of the overall sentiment and loyalty of all survey participants across the entire dataset. Table result An NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 35 means that the overall sentiment of customers towards a company, product, or service is positive but has room for improvement. The NPS is measured on a scale from -100 to +100. It shows that there are more promoters than detractors, but there is still room for improvement to further increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 6.5 Use Case 5 To calculate EBA NPS SQL query: with count_rows as (select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as qualtrics_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where EBA_FLAG = 'TRUE') ,total_promoters as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as promoters_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score >='9' AND EBA_FLAG = 'TRUE') ,total_detractors as ( Select count(distinct qualtrics_id) as detractors_count from \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" where score <='6' AND EBA_FLAG = 'TRUE') select promoters_perc - detractors_perc as overall_eba_nps from ( select promoters_count/qualtrics_count as promoters_perc, detractors_count/qualtrics_count as detractors_perc from count_rows,total_promoters,total_detractors ) Overall EBA NPS 60 Table Summary \"Overall EBA NPS\" represents the calculated Net Promoter Score for EBA (Employee-Based Access) Qualtrics survey responses. The table contains a single row, and the value \"60\" indicates the EBA-specific Net Promoter Score resulting from the analysis. The EBA NPS is derived by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters, considering only EBA responses. This score provides an assessment of customer sentiment and loyalty specifically for Employee-Based Access survey participants. Table results An overall EBA (Employee-Based Access) NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 60 means that the sentiment of employees who have access to a company's products or services is highly positive. It indicates that a significant majority of employees who have access to the company's products or services are promoters. This suggests a high level of employee satisfaction and loyalty, which is beneficial for the company as it indicates a positive work environment and can lead to higher employee engagement and productivity. 6.6 Use Case 6 To connect NPS table with applicable dimensions SQL query: WITH ACCOUNT_CED AS ( SELECT -- site location identifying information t_map.account_csn as ACCOUNT_CSN ,SITE_TYPE ,SITE_COUNTRY_NAME ,SITE_GEO ,SITE_INDUSTRY_SEGMENT ,SITE_INDUSTRY_GROUP ,PARTNER_SITE_TYPE ,SITE_SALES_REGION ,SITE_TYPE ,SITE_NAMED_ACCOUNT_GROUP_STATIC ,CORPORATE_CUSTOMER_SIZE_STATIC from adp_publish.account_optimized.account_edp_optimized account_ced inner join adp_publish.account_optimized.transactional_csn_mapping_optimized t_map on t_map.site_uuid_csn = account_ced.site_uuid_csn ) SELECT SCORE, ACCOUNT_CED.* \"EIO_PUBLISH\".\"ENGAGEMENT_SHARED\".\"NPS_EBA_NON_EBA_SURVEY\" SURVEY LEFT JOIN ACCOUNT_CED ON SURVEY.ACCOUNT_CSN = ACCOUNT_CED.ACCOUNT_CSN SCORE ACCOUNT_CSN SITE_TYPE SITE_COUNTRY_NAME SITE_GEO SITE_INDUSTRY_SEGMENT SITE_INDUSTRY_GROUP 9 CSN_001 Type_A Country_X Geo_1 Segment_1 Group_A 7 CSN_002 Type_B Country_Y Geo_2 Segment_2 Group_B 8 CSN_003 Type_C Country_Z Geo_3 Segment_3 Group_C Table Summary \"SCORE\" represents the Net Promoter Score for each survey response. \"ACCOUNT_CSN\" is the customer account identifier that connects the NPS survey responses to specific customers in the \"ACCOUNT_CED\" result set. Other columns like \"SITE_TYPE,\" \"SITE_COUNTRY_NAME,\" \"SITE_GEO,\" \"SITE_INDUSTRY_SEGMENT,\" \"SITE_INDUSTRY_GROUP,\" and more represent site location and customer attributes from the \"ACCOUNT_CED\" result set. The table combines NPS data with relevant dimensions from \"ACCOUNT_CED\" using a LEFT JOIN. This links each NPS survey response to its corresponding customer and includes additional information about site location and industry segment. Table Result We can leverage NPS tables to facilitate in-depth analysis by exploring NPS scores alongside specific customer attributes, gaining insights into customer feedback and loyalty based on different dimensions. 7.
